#Planning
- Pseudo Code to help layout HTML and CSS - what page will look like and how it will be styled
- Pseudo Code to help layout working parts/pieces of Javascript
- Using youtube videos and other websites to understand what I needed and how to make it operate within my code

#Issues
- This was a difficult assignment where I felt like I needed a lot of help - tutor, web videos and fellow classmates
- One of the hardest parts was creating the high scores, adding them to local storage and then getting the scores to display
